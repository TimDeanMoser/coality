__label__other <p>There are two main features provided by the implementations of this interface:</p><h3>Serialization</h3><p>If the underlying data store requires serialization, data will be serialized to and deserializedusing a {@link KVStoreSerializer}, which can be customized by the application. The serializer isbased on Jackson, so it supports all the Jackson annotations for controlling the serialization ofapp-defined types.</p><p>Data is also automatically compressed to save disk space.</p><h3>Automatic Key Management</h3><p>When using the built-in key management, the implementation will automatically create uniquekeys for each type written to the store. Keys are based on the type name, and always startwith the "+" prefix character (so that it's easy to use both manual and automatic keymanagement APIs without conflicts).</p><p>Another feature of automatic key management is indexing; by annotating fields or methods ofobjects written to the store with {@link KVIndex}, indices are created to sort the databy the values of those properties. This makes it possible to provide sorting without havingto load all instances of those types from the store.</p><p>KVStore instances are thread-safe for both reads and writes.</p>

__label__other A byte source that reads from a URL using {@link URL#openStream()}
__label__other The simplest way to maintain a rate of QPS is to keep the timestamp of the last grantedrequest, and ensure that (1/QPS) seconds have elapsed since then. For example, for a rate ofQPS=5 (5 tokens per second), if we ensure that a request isn't granted earlier than 200ms afterthe last one, then we achieve the intended rate. If a request comes and the last request wasgranted only 100ms ago, then we wait for another 100ms. At this rate, serving 15 fresh permits(i.e. for an acquire(15) request) naturally takes 3 seconds.It is important to realize that such a RateLimiter has a very superficial memory of the past:it only remembers the last request. What if the RateLimiter was unused for a long period oftime, then a request arrived and was immediately granted? This RateLimiter would immediatelyforget about that past underutilization. This may result in either underutilization oroverflow, depending on the real world consequences of not using the expected rate.Past underutilization could mean that excess resources are available. Then, the RateLimitershould speed up for a while, to take advantage of these resources. This is important when therate is applied to networking (limiting bandwidth), where past underutilization typicallytranslates to "almost empty buffers", which can be filled immediately.On the other hand, past underutilization could mean that "the server responsible for handlingthe request has become less ready for future requests", i.e. its caches become stale, andrequests become more likely to trigger expensive operations (a more extreme case of thisexample is when a server has just booted, and it is mostly busy with getting itself up tospeed).To deal with such scenarios, we add an extra dimension, that of "past underutilization",modeled by "storedPermits" variable. This variable is zero when there is no underutilization,and it can grow up to maxStoredPermits, for sufficiently large underutilization. So, therequested permits, by an invocation acquire(permits), are served from:- stored permits (if available)- fresh permits (for any remaining permits)This implements the following function where coldInterval = coldFactorstableInterval.<pre>^ throttling cold + /interval /. / . / . ← "warmup period" is the area of the trapezoid between / . thresholdPermits and maxPermits / . / . / .stable +----------/ WARM .interval . UP . . PERIOD. . .0 +----------+-------+--------------→ storedPermits0 thresholdPermits maxPermits</pre>Before going into the details of this particular function, let's keep in mind the basics:<ol><li>The state of the RateLimiter (storedPermits) is a vertical line in this figure.<li>When the RateLimiter is not used, this goes right (up to maxPermits)<li>When the RateLimiter is used, this goes left (down to zero), since if we havestoredPermits, we serve from those first<li>When _unused_, we go right at a constant rate! The rate at which we move to the right ischosen as maxPermits / warmupPeriod. This ensures that the time it takes to go from 0 tomaxPermits is equal to warmupPeriod.<li>When _used_, the time it takes, as explained in the introductory class note, is equal tothe integral of our function, between X permits and X-K permits, assuming we want tospend K saved permits.</ol>

This cannot just be the a single proxy since we couldfailover across a number of NameNodes, rather than just between an active and a standby.<p>We - lazily - get a proxy to one of the configured namenodes and attempt to make the requestagainst it. If it doesn't succeed, either because the proxy failed to be created or the requestfailed, we try the next NN in the list. We try this up to the configuration maximum number ofretries before throwing up our hands. A working proxy is retained across attempts since weexpect the active NameNode to switch rarely.<p>This mechanism is <b>very bad</b> for cases where we care about being <i>fast</i>; it justblindly goes and tries namenodes.

__label__other In some cases GDB reports 'exec-' commands failure after the '^running' event is fired. For instance, if an invalid breakpoint is set no error is reported but the consequent 'exec-continue' command fails.
__label__other A Map of threadId -> FramesCacheInfo, that can be cleared based on a context. We use this cache for a few reasons: <br> First, two commands such as <pre> -stack-info-depth 11 -stack-info-depth 2 </pre> would both be sent to GDB because the command cache sees them as different. This cache allows us to know that if we already asked for a stack depth we can potentially re-use the answer. <br> The same concept is applicable for the -stack-list-frames command with different limits. Also, the stack depth can be deduced from the frames list, so we don't need to ask gdb for it again. <p> The second reason is that gdb is unreliable when it comes to returning frames. The MI protocol only allows to reply with data or with error. When gdb is unwinding sometimes it gets both, and while the console CLI protocol has no problem with that, for MI, gdb replies randomly, sometimes with data, sometimes with error. If we cache the valid data it will eliminate the issue with invalid data on subsequent invocations. We don't cache errors. Base class for the IFrameDMData object that uses an MIFrame object toprovide the data. Sub-classes must provide the MIFrame object
__label__other We don't actually make the console read-only because it is nice for the user to be able to add delimiters such as empty lines within the traces.

__label__other We benchmark a "callerfinder" implementation that might be used in a logging framework.
__label__other Comparing to using a traditional {@code HashMap}implementation which stores keys and count values as map entries, {@code ObjectCountHashMap}minimizes object allocation and reduces memory footprint.
__label__other This implements a "bursty" RateLimiter, where storedPermits are translated to zero throttling.The maximum number of permits that can be saved (when the RateLimiter is unused) is defined interms of time, in this sense: if a RateLimiter is 2qps, and this time is specified as 10seconds, we can save up to 210 = 20 permits.It is important to realize that such a RateLimiter has a very superficial memory of the past:it only remembers the last request. What if the RateLimiter was unused for a long period oftime, then a request arrived and was immediately granted? This RateLimiter would immediatelyforget about that past underutilization. This may result in either underutilization oroverflow, depending on the real world consequences of not using the expected rate.
__label__other An enum cannot be implemented by anything, so it should not be possible to have a successful Valid JITable binding

__label__other <p>In addition to {@link #execute}, subclasses must implement all methods related to shutdown andtermination.
__label__other <p>To implement a cache, the programmer needs only to extend this class and provide animplementation for the {@link #get(Object)} and {@link #getIfPresent} methods. {@link#getUnchecked}, {@link #get(Object, Callable)}, and {@link #getAll} are implemented in terms of{@code get}; {@link #getAllPresent} is implemented in terms of {@code getIfPresent}; {@link#putAll} is implemented in terms of {@link #put}, {@link #invalidateAll(Iterable)} is implementedin terms of {@link #invalidate}. The method {@link #cleanUp} is a no-op. All other methods throwan {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
__label__other <p>All default instances returned by {@link #get} are generics-safe. Clients won't get typeerrors for using {@code get(Comparator.class)} as a {@code Comparator<Foo>}, for example.Immutable empty instances are returned for collection types; {@code ""} for string; {@code 0} fornumber types; reasonable default instance for other stateless types. For mutable types, a freshinstance is created each time {@code get()} is called.
__label__other @param <T> the type of instances that the {@code BloomFilter} accepts. Cheat sheet: m: total bits n: expected insertions b: m/n, bits per insertion p: expected false positive probability 1) Optimal k = bln2 2) p = (1 - e ^ (-kn/m))^k 3) For optimal k: p = 2 ^ (-k) ~= 0.6185^b 4) For optimal k: m = -nlnp / ((ln2) ^ 2) A strategy to translate T instances, to {@code numHashFunctions} bit indexes.<p>Implementations should be collections of pure functions (i.e. stateless).
__label__other <p>These features are all optional; caches can be created using all or none of them. By defaultcache instances created by {@code CacheBuilder} will not perform any type of eviction.<p>Usage example:<pre>{@codeLoadingCache<Key, Graph> graphs = CacheBuilder.newBuilder().maximumSize(10000).expireAfterWrite(Duration.ofMinutes(10)).removalListener(MY_LISTENER).build(new CacheLoader<Key, Graph>() {public Graph load(Key key) throws AnyException {return createExpensiveGraph(key);}});}</pre><p>Or equivalently,<pre>{@code// In real life this would come from a command-line flag or config fileString spec = "maximumSize=10000,expireAfterWrite=10m";LoadingCache<Key, Graph> graphs = CacheBuilder.from(spec).removalListener(MY_LISTENER).build(new CacheLoader<Key, Graph>() {public Graph load(Key key) throws AnyException {return createExpensiveGraph(key);}});}</pre><p>The returned cache is implemented as a hash table with similar performance characteristics to{@link ConcurrentHashMap}. It implements all optional operations of the {@link LoadingCache} and{@link Cache} interfaces. The {@code asMap} view (and its collection views) have <i>weaklyconsistent iterators</i>. This means that they are safe for concurrent use, but if other threadsmodify the cache after the iterator is created, it is undefined which of these changes, if any,are reflected in that iterator. These iterators never throw {@linkConcurrentModificationException}.<p><b>Note:</b> by default, the returned cache uses equality comparisons (the {@linkObject#equals equals} method) to determine equality for keys or values. However, if {@link#weakKeys} was specified, the cache uses identity ({@code ==}) comparisons instead for keys.Likewise, if {@link #weakValues} or {@link #softValues} was specified, the cache uses identitycomparisons for values.<p>Entries are automatically evicted from the cache when any of {@linkplain #maximumSize(long)maximumSize}, {@linkplain #maximumWeight(long) maximumWeight}, {@linkplain #expireAfterWriteexpireAfterWrite}, {@linkplain #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess}, {@linkplain #weakKeysweakKeys}, {@linkplain #weakValues weakValues}, or {@linkplain #softValues softValues} arerequested.<p>If {@linkplain #maximumSize(long) maximumSize} or {@linkplain #maximumWeight(long)maximumWeight} is requested entries may be evicted on each cache modification.<p>If {@linkplain #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite} or {@linkplain #expireAfterAccessexpireAfterAccess} is requested entries may be evicted on each cache modification, on occasionalcache accesses, or on calls to {@link Cache#cleanUp}. Expired entries may be counted by {@linkCache#size}, but will never be visible to read or write operations.<p>If {@linkplain #weakKeys weakKeys}, {@linkplain #weakValues weakValues}, or {@linkplain#softValues softValues} are requested, it is possible for a key or value present in the cache tobe reclaimed by the garbage collector. Entries with reclaimed keys or values may be removed fromthe cache on each cache modification, on occasional cache accesses, or on calls to {@linkCache#cleanUp}; such entries may be counted in {@link Cache#size}, but will never be visible toread or write operations.<p>Certain cache configurations will result in the accrual of periodic maintenance tasks whichwill be performed during write operations, or during occasional read operations in the absence ofwrites. The {@link Cache#cleanUp} method of the returned cache will also perform maintenance, butcalling it should not be necessary with a high throughput cache. Only caches built with{@linkplain #removalListener removalListener}, {@linkplain #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite},{@linkplain #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess}, {@linkplain #weakKeys weakKeys}, {@linkplain#weakValues weakValues}, or {@linkplain #softValues softValues} perform periodic maintenance.<p>The caches produced by {@code CacheBuilder} are serializable, and the deserialized cachesretain all the configuration properties of the original cache. Note that the serialized form does<i>not</i> include cache contents, but only configuration.@param <K> the most general key type this builder will be able to create caches for.

__label__other <p>To map a generic type to an instance of that type, use {@linkcom.google.common.reflect.TypeToInstanceMap} instead.@param <B> the common supertype that all entries must share; often this is simply {@link Object}
__label__other <p>The simplest use case is:<pre>new EqualsTester().addEqualityGroup(foo).testEquals();</pre><p>This tests {@code foo.equals(foo)}, {@code foo.equals(null)}, and a few other operations.<p>For more extensive testing, add multiple equality groups. Each group should contain objectsthat are equal to each other but unequal to the objects in any other group. For example:<pre>new EqualsTester().addEqualityGroup(new User("page"), new User("page")).addEqualityGroup(new User("sergey")).testEquals();</pre> Class used to test whether equals() correctly handles an instance of an incompatible class.Since it is a private inner class, the invoker can never pass in an instance to the tester
__label__other @param <B> The concrete type of this builder (the 'self-type'). All the Builder methods of thisclass (such as {@link #named}) return this type, so that Builder methods of more derivedclasses can be chained onto them without casting.@param <G> The type of the generator to be passed to testers in the generated test suite. Aninstance of G should somehow provide an instance of the class under test, plus any otherinformation required to parameterize the test.

__label__other <p>In the absence of element deletions, this will iterate over elements in insertion order.
__label__other This allows constructs such as<pre>{@codepublic static double sqrt(double value) {if (value < 0) {throw new IllegalArgumentException("input is negative: " + value);}// calculate square root}}</pre><p>to be replaced with the more compact<pre>{@codepublic static double sqrt(double value) {checkArgument(value >= 0, "input is negative: %s", value);// calculate square root}}</pre><p>so that a hypothetical bad caller of this method, such as:<pre>{@codevoid exampleBadCaller() {double d = sqrt(-1.0);}}</pre><p>would be flagged as having called {@code sqrt()} with an illegal argument.<h3>Performance</h3><p>Avoid passing message arguments that are expensive to compute; your code will always computethem, even though they usually won't be needed. If you have such arguments, use the conventionalif/throw idiom instead.<p>Depending on your message arguments, memory may be allocated for boxing and varargs arraycreation. However, the methods of this class have a large number of overloads that prevent suchallocations in many common cases.<p>The message string is not formatted unless the exception will be thrown, so the cost of thestring formatting itself should not be a concern.<p>As with any performance concerns, you should consider profiling your code (in a productionenvironment if possible) before spending a lot of effort on tweaking a particular element.<h3>Other types of preconditions</h3><p>Not every type of precondition failure is supported by these methods. Continue to throwstandard JDK exceptions such as {@link java.util.NoSuchElementException} or {@linkUnsupportedOperationException} in the situations they are intended for.<h3>Non-preconditions</h3><p>It is of course possible to use the methods of this class to check for invalid conditionswhich are <i>not the caller's fault</i>. Doing so is <b>not recommended</b> because it ismisleading to future readers of the code and of stack traces. See <ahref="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ConditionalFailuresExplained">Conditional failuresexplained</a> in the Guava User Guide for more advice. Notably, {@link Verify} offers assertionssimilar to those in this class for non-precondition checks.<h3>{@code java.util.Objects.requireNonNull()}</h3><p>Projects which use {@code com.google.common} should generally avoid the use of {@linkjava.util.Objects#requireNonNull(Object)}. Instead, use whichever of {@link#checkNotNull(Object)} or {@link Verify#verifyNotNull(Object)} is appropriate to the situation.(The same goes for the message-accepting overloads.)<h3>Only {@code %s} is supported</h3><p>{@code Preconditions} uses {@link Strings#lenientFormat} to format error message templatestrings. This only supports the {@code "%s"} specifier, not the full range of {@linkjava.util.Formatter} specifiers. However, note that if the number of arguments does not match thenumber of occurrences of {@code "%s"} in the format string, {@code Preconditions} will stillbehave as expected, and will still include all argument values in the error message; the messagewill simply not be formatted exactly as intended.
__label__other <p>All method parameters must be non-null unless documented otherwise.
__label__other How this works is best explained with an example:For a RateLimiter that produces 1 token per second, every second that goes by with theRateLimiter being unused, we increase storedPermits by 1. Say we leave the RateLimiter unusedfor 10 seconds (i.e., we expected a request at time X, but we are at time X + 10 seconds beforea request actually arrives; this is also related to the point made in the last paragraph), thusstoredPermits becomes 10.0 (assuming maxStoredPermits >= 10.0). At that point, a request ofacquire(3) arrives. We serve this request out of storedPermits, and reduce that to 7.0 (howthis is translated to throttling time is discussed later). Immediately after, assume that anacquire(10) request arriving. We serve the request partly from storedPermits, using all theremaining 7.0 permits, and the remaining 3.0, we serve them by fresh permits produced by therate limiter.We already know how much time it takes to serve 3 fresh permits: if the rate is"1 token per second", then this will take 3 seconds. But what does it mean to serve 7 storedpermits? As explained above, there is no unique answer. If we are primarily interested to dealwith underutilization, then we want stored permits to be given out /faster/ than fresh ones,because underutilization = free resources for the taking. If we are primarily interested todeal with overflow, then stored permits could be given out /slower/ than fresh ones. Thus, werequire a (different in each case) function that translates storedPermits to throttling time.This role is played by storedPermitsToWaitTime(double storedPermits, double permitsToTake). Theunderlying model is a continuous function mapping storedPermits (from 0.0 to maxStoredPermits)onto the 1/rate (i.e. intervals) that is effective at the given storedPermits. "storedPermits"essentially measure unused time; we spend unused time buying/storing permits. Rate is"permits / time", thus "1 / rate = time / permits". Thus, "1/rate" (time / permits) times"permits" gives time, i.e., integrals on this function (which is what storedPermitsToWaitTime()computes) correspond to minimum intervals between subsequent requests, for the specified numberof requested permits.Here is an example of storedPermitsToWaitTime: If storedPermits == 10.0, and we want 3 permits,we take them from storedPermits, reducing them to 7.0, and compute the throttling for these asa call to storedPermitsToWaitTime(storedPermits = 10.0, permitsToTake = 3.0), which willevaluate the integral of the function from 7.0 to 10.0.Using integrals guarantees that the effect of a single acquire(3) is equivalent to {acquire(1); acquire(1); acquire(1); }, or { acquire(2); acquire(1); }, etc, since the integralof the function in [7.0, 10.0] is equivalent to the sum of the integrals of [7.0, 8.0], [8.0,9.0], [9.0, 10.0] (and so on), no matter what the function is. This guarantees that we handlecorrectly requests of varying weight (permits), /no matter/ what the actual function is - so wecan tweak the latter freely. (The only requirement, obviously, is that we can compute itsintegrals). If we pick a function that goes /below/ that horizontal line, it means that we reduce the areaof the function, thus time. Thus, the RateLimiter becomes /faster/ after a period ofunderutilization. If, on the other hand, we pick a function that goes /above/ that horizontalline, then it means that the area (time) is increased, thus storedPermits are more costly thanfresh permits, thus the RateLimiter becomes /slower/ after a period of underutilization.Last, but not least: consider a RateLimiter with rate of 1 permit per second, currentlycompletely unused, and an expensive acquire(100) request comes. It would be nonsensical to justwait for 100 seconds, and /then/ start the actual task. Why wait without doing anything? A muchbetter approach is to /allow/ the request right away (as if it was an acquire(1) requestinstead), and postpone /subsequent/ requests as needed. In this version, we allow starting thetask immediately, and postpone by 100 seconds future requests, thus we allow for work to getdone in the meantime instead of waiting idly.This has important consequences: it means that the RateLimiter doesn't remember the time of the_last_ request, but it remembers the (expected) time of the _next_ request. This also enablesus to tell immediately (see tryAcquire(timeout)) whether a particular timeout is enough to getus to the point of the next scheduling time, since we always maintain that. And what we mean by"an unused RateLimiter" is also defined by that notion: when we observe that the"expected arrival time of the next request" is actually in the past, then the difference (now -past) is the amount of time that the RateLimiter was formally unused, and it is that amount oftime which we translate to storedPermits. (We increase storedPermits with the amount of permitsthat would have been produced in that idle time). So, if rate == 1 permit per second, andarrivals come exactly one second after the previous, then storedPermits is _never_ increased --we would only increase it for arrivals _later_ than the expected one second. The time when the next request (no matter its size) will be granted. After granting a request,this is pushed further in the future. Large requests push this further than small requests.

__label__other Simply extend this class, implement {@link #configure()}, and call the inheritedmethods which mirror those found in {@link Binder}. For example:<pre>public class MyModule extends AbstractModule {protected void configure() {bind(Service.class).to(ServiceImpl.class).in(Singleton.class);bind(CreditCardPaymentService.class);bind(PaymentService.class).to(CreditCardPaymentService.class);bindConstant().annotatedWith(Names.named("port")).to(8080);}}</pre>
__label__other <h3>The Guice Binding EDSL</h3>Guice uses an <i>embedded domain-specific language</i>, or EDSL, to help you create bindingssimply and readably. This approach is great for overall usability, but it does come with a smallcost: <b>it is difficult to learn how to use the Binding EDSL by reading method-leveljavadocs</b>. Instead, you should consult the series of examples below. To save space, theseexamples omit the opening {@code binder}, just as you will if your module extends {@linkAbstractModule}.<pre>bind(ServiceImpl.class);</pre>This statement does essentially nothing; it "binds the {@code ServiceImpl} class to itself" anddoes not change Guice's default behavior. You may still want to use this if you prefer your{@link Module} class to serve as an explicit <i>manifest</i> for the services it provides. Also,in rare cases, Guice may be unable to validate a binding at injector creation time unless it isgiven explicitly.<pre>bind(Service.class).to(ServiceImpl.class);</pre>Specifies that a request for a {@code Service} instance with no binding annotations should betreated as if it were a request for a {@code ServiceImpl} instance. This <i>overrides</i> thefunction of any {@link ImplementedBy @ImplementedBy} or {@link ProvidedBy @ProvidedBy}annotations found on {@code Service}, since Guice will have already "moved on" to {@codeServiceImpl} before it reaches the point when it starts looking for these annotations.<pre>bind(Service.class).toProvider(ServiceProvider.class);</pre>In this example, {@code ServiceProvider} must extend or implement {@code Provider<Service>}. Thisbinding specifies that Guice should resolve an unannotated injection request for {@code Service}by first resolving an instance of {@code ServiceProvider} in the regular way, then calling {@linkProvider#get get()} on the resulting Provider instance to obtain the {@code Service} instance.<p>The {@link Provider} you use here does not have to be a "factory"; that is, a provider whichalways <i>creates</i> each instance it provides. However, this is generally a good practice tofollow. You can then use Guice's concept of {@link Scope scopes} to guide when creation shouldhappen -- "letting Guice work for you".<pre>bind(Service.class).annotatedWith(Red.class).to(ServiceImpl.class);</pre>Like the previous example, but only applies to injection requests that use the binding annotation{@code @Red}. If your module also includes bindings for particular <i>values</i> of the{@code @Red} annotation (see below), then this binding will serve as a "catch-all" for any valuesof {@code @Red} that have no exact match in the bindings.<pre>bind(ServiceImpl.class).in(Singleton.class);// or, alternativelybind(ServiceImpl.class).in(Scopes.SINGLETON);</pre>Either of these statements places the {@code ServiceImpl} class into singleton scope. Guice willcreate only one instance of {@code ServiceImpl} and will reuse it for all injection requests ofthis type. Note that it is still possible to bind another instance of {@code ServiceImpl} if thesecond binding is qualified by an annotation as in the previous example. Guice is not overlyconcerned with <i>preventing</i> you from creating multiple instances of your "singletons", onlywith <i>enabling</i> your application to share only one instance if that's all you tell Guice youneed.<p><b>Note:</b> a scope specified in this way <i>overrides</i> any scope that was specified withan annotation on the {@code ServiceImpl} class.<p>Besides {@link Singleton}/{@link Scopes#SINGLETON}, there are servlet-specific scopesavailable in {@code com.google.inject.servlet.ServletScopes}, and your Modules can contributetheir own custom scopes for use here as well.<pre>bind(new TypeLiteral&lt;PaymentService&lt;CreditCard>>() {}).to(CreditCardPaymentService.class);</pre>This admittedly odd construct is the way to bind a parameterized type. It tells Guice how tohonor an injection request for an element of type {@code PaymentService<CreditCard>}. The class{@code CreditCardPaymentService} must implement the {@code PaymentService<CreditCard>} interface.Guice cannot currently bind or inject a generic type, such as {@code Set<E>}; all type parametersmust be fully specified.<pre>bind(Service.class).toInstance(new ServiceImpl());// or, alternativelybind(Service.class).toInstance(SomeLegacyRegistry.getService());</pre>In this example, your module itself, <i>not Guice</i>, takes responsibility for obtaining a{@code ServiceImpl} instance, then asks Guice to always use this single instance to fulfill all{@code Service} injection requests. When the {@link Injector} is created, it will automaticallyperform field and method injection for this instance, but any injectable constructor on {@codeServiceImpl} is simply ignored. Note that using this approach results in "eager loading" behaviorthat you can't control.<pre>bindConstant().annotatedWith(ServerHost.class).to(args[0]);</pre>Sets up a constant binding. Constant injections must always be annotated. When a constantbinding's value is a string, it is eligible for conversion to all primitive types, to {@linkEnum#valueOf(Class, String) all enums}, and to {@link Class#forName class literals}. Conversionsfor other types can be configured using {@link #convertToTypes(Matcher, TypeConverter)convertToTypes()}.<pre>{@literal @}Color("red") Color red; // A member variable (field). . .red = MyModule.class.getDeclaredField("red").getAnnotation(Color.class);bind(Service.class).annotatedWith(red).to(RedService.class);</pre>If your binding annotation has parameters you can apply different bindings to different specificvalues of your annotation. Getting your hands on the right instance of the annotation is a bit ofa pain -- one approach, shown above, is to apply a prototype annotation to a field in your moduleclass, so that you can read this annotation instance and give it to Guice.<pre>bind(Service.class).annotatedWith(Names.named("blue")).to(BlueService.class);</pre>Differentiating by names is a common enough use case that we provided a standard annotation,{@link com.google.inject.name.Named @Named}. Because of Guice's library support, binding by nameis quite easier than in the arbitrary binding annotation case we just saw. However, remember thatthese names will live in a single flat namespace with all the other names used in yourapplication.<pre>Constructor<T> loneCtor = getLoneCtorFromServiceImplViaReflection();bind(ServiceImpl.class).toConstructor(loneCtor);</pre>In this example, we directly tell Guice which constructor to use in a concrete classimplementation. It means that we do not need to place {@literal @}Inject on any of theconstructors and that Guice treats the provided constructor as though it were annotated so. It isuseful for cases where you cannot modify existing classes and is a bit simpler than using a{@link Provider}.<p>The above list of examples is far from exhaustive. If you can think of how the concepts of oneexample might coexist with the concepts from another, you can most likely weave the two together.If the two concepts make no sense with each other, you most likely won't be able to do it. In afew cases Guice will let something bogus slip by, and will then inform you of the problems atruntime, as soon as you try to create your Injector.<p>The other methods of Binder such as {@link #bindScope}, {@link #bindInterceptor}, {@link#install}, {@link #requestStaticInjection}, {@link #addError} and {@link #currentStage} are notpart of the Binding EDSL; you can learn how to use these in the usual way, from the methoddocumentation./"

__label__other This policy works in combination with an implementation of taskcheckpointing. It computes the tasks to be preempted in response to the RMrequest for preemption. For strict requests, it maps containers tocorresponding tasks; for fungible requests, it attempts to pick the bestcontainers to preempt (reducers in reverse allocation order). TheTaskAttemptListener will interrogate this policy when handling a taskheartbeat to check whether the task should be preempted or not. When handlingfungible requests, the policy discount the RM ask by the amount of currentlyin-flight preemptions (i.e., tasks that are checkpointing).This class it is also used to maintain the list of checkpoints for existingtasks. Centralizing this functionality here, allows us to have visibility onpreemption and checkpoints in a single location, thus coordinating preemptionand checkpoint management decisions in a single policy.

__label__other Threshold for the maximum number of key to record in a dynamic Bloom filter row.
__label__other Implements a <i>dynamic Bloom filter<i>, as defined in the INFOCOM 2006 paper.<p>A dynamic Bloom filter (DBF) makes use of a <code>sm<code> bit matrix buteach of the <code>s<code> rows is a standard Bloom filter. The creationprocess of a DBF is iterative. At the start, the DBF is a <code>1m<code>bit matrix, i.e., it is composed of a single standard Bloom filter.It assumes that <code>n<sub>r<sub><code> elements are recorded in theinitial bit vector, where <code>n<sub>r<sub> <= n<code> (<code>n<code> isthe cardinality of the set <code>A<code> to record in the filter).<p>As the size of <code>A<code> grows during the execution of the application,several keys must be inserted in the DBF. When inserting a key into the DBF,one must first get an active Bloom filter in the matrix. A Bloom filter isactive when the number of recorded keys, <code>n<sub>r<sub><code>, isstrictly less than the current cardinality of <code>A<code>, <code>n<code>.If an active Bloom filter is found, the key is inserted and<code>n<sub>r<sub><code> is incremented by one. On the other hand, if thereis no active Bloom filter, a new one is created (i.e., a new row is added tothe matrix) according to the current size of <code>A<code> and the elementis added in this new Bloom filter and the <code>n<sub>r<sub><code> value ofthis new Bloom filter is set to one. A given key is said to belong to theDBF if the <code>k<code> positions are set to one in one of the matrix rows.<p>Originally created by<a href="http:www.one-lab.org">European Commission One-Lab Project 034819<a>.

__label__other The {@link JWTRedirectAuthenticationHandler} extendsAltKerberosAuthenticationHandler to add WebSSO behavior for UIs. The expectedSSO token is a JsonWebToken (JWT). The supported algorithm is RS256 whichuses PKI between the token issuer and consumer. The flow requires a redirectto a configured authentication server URL and a subsequent request with theexpected JWT token. This token is cryptographically verified and validated.The user identity is then extracted from the token and used to create anAuthenticationToken - as expected by the AuthenticationFilter.
__label__other Primarily for testing, this provides a way to set the publicKey forsignature verification without needing to get a PEM encoded value.

__label__other Finds the Jar for a class. If the class is in a directory in theclasspath, it creates a Jar on the fly with the contents of the directoryand returns the path to that Jar. If a Jar is created, it is created inthe system temporary directory.
__label__other The below logic allows us to keep the checked state of the toggle button  properly set. This is because in some case, the checked state may change  without the user actually pressing the button. For instance, if we restart  the inferior, the toggle may automatically turn off.  To figure this out, whenever a debug context changes, we make sure we are  showing the proper checked state.

__label__other An implementation of {@link VaadinSession} for JSR-286 portlet environments.This is automatically registered as a {@link HttpSessionBindingListener} when{@link PortletSession#setAttribute()} is called with the context as value.Only the documented parts of this class should be considered as stable publicAPI.Note also that some methods andor nested interfaces might move to{@link VaadinPortletService} in future minor or major versions of Vaadin. Inthese cases, a deprecated redirection for backwards compatibility will beused in VaadinPortletSession for a transition period.
__label__other Listener interface for the various types of JSR-286 portlet requests. Thelistener methods are called by the request handler{@link PortletListenerNotifier} after the session is locked and thecorresponding UI has been found (if already created) but before otherrequest processing takes place.Direct rendering of output is not possible in a portlet listener and theJSR-286 limitations on allowed operations in each phase or portletrequest processing must be respected by the listeners.Note that internal action requests used by the framework to triggerevents or set shared parameters do not call the action request listenerbut will result in a later event or render request that will trigger thecorresponding listener.
__label__other This service maintains the shared cache meta data. It handles claiming andreleasing of resources, all rpc calls from the client to the shared cachemanager, and administrative commands. It also persists the shared cache metadata to a backend store, and cleans up stale entries on a regular basis.

__label__other The corrupt block has to be removed when the number of valid replicasmatches replication factor for the file. In this test, the abovecondition is achieved by increasing the number of good replicas byreplicating on a new Datanode.The test strategy :Bring up Cluster with 3 DataNodesCreate a file of replication factor 3Corrupt one replica of a block of the fileVerify that there are still 2 good replicas and 1 corrupt replica(corrupt replica should not be removed since number of good replicas(2) is less than replication factor (3))Start a new data nodeVerify that the a new replica is created and corrupt replica isremoved.
__label__other The corrupt block has to be removed when the number of valid replicasmatches replication factor for the file. The above condition should holdtrue as long as there is one good replica. This test verifies that.The test strategy :Bring up Cluster with 2 DataNodesCreate a file of replication factor 2Corrupt one replica of a block of the fileVerify that there is one good replicas and 1 corrupt replica(corrupt replica should not be removed since number of goodreplicas (1) is less than replication factor (2)).Set the replication factor to 1Verify that the corrupt replica is removed.(corrupt replica should be removed since number of goodreplicas (1) is equal to replication factor (1))

__label__other This is wire-incompatible with Hadoop 2.0.0-alpha due to HDFS-3721  because it changes the length of the packet header, and BlockReceiver  in that version did not support variable-length headers.
__label__other The hostdomain name and port are set as separate strings in the addresslist
__label__other These are provide as a 3 element tuple of: hostname, portand optionally path (depending on the application)
__label__other previous layout pass may have changed the position already, needs to  be reset before calculating which positioning should be used
__label__other Dragging curtain interferes with click events if added in  mousedown so we add it only when needed i.e., if the mouse moves  outside the splitter.
__label__other Reset the resized flag after a mouseup has occured so the next  mousedownmouseup can be interpreted as a click.
__label__other Each ModifyDialogTabPage has its own instance,and it should add all relevant controls upon creation, always in the same sequence.This established a mapping of controls to indexes, which allows to restore the focusin a later session.The index is saved in the dialog settings, and there is only one common preference forall tab pages. It is always the currently active tab page which stores its focusindex.
__label__other The standard Preference object are managed by this focus manager if they are createdusing the respective factory methods. Other SWT widgets can be added in subclasseswhen they are created.
__label__other This class provides common implementation for CPPTemplateNonTypeParameterSpecialization,CPPTemplateTypeParameterSpecialization, and CPPTemplateTemplateParameterSpecialization.
__label__other By default the range is inclusive i.e. both minValue and maxValue arevalid values. Use {@link #setMinValueIncluded(boolean)} or{@link #setMaxValueIncluded(boolean)} to change it.
__label__other The client uses a checksum to identify theresource and an {@link ApplicationId} to identify which application will beusing the resource.<p><p>The <code>SharedCacheManager<code> responds with whether or not theresource exists in the cache. If the resource exists, a <code>Path<code>to the resource in the shared cache is returned. If the resource does notexist, the response is empty.
__label__other This method is called once an applicationis no longer using a claimed resource in the shared cache. The client usesa checksum to identify the resource and an {@link ApplicationId} toidentify which application is releasing the resource.<p>
__label__other A simple heuristic is used to detect valid line end comment characters: If acharacter known to be a potential line end comment character is used as aline start comment char, this character is considered a valid line endcomment character, too. If e.g. a '@' is used to introduce a line startcomment it is also recognized as a line end comment introducer afterwards.<p>
__label__other This function is called when setting a filter for this generatedproperty. Returning null from this function causesGeneratedPropertyContainer to discard the filter and not use it.By default this function throws UnsupportedFilterException.
__label__other SortOrder is similar to (or the same as) the SortOrder already definedfor Grid.The default implementation of this method returns an empty array, whichmeans that the property will not be included ingetSortableContainerPropertyIds(). Attempting to sort by that columnthrows UnsupportedOperationException.Returning null is not allowed.
__label__other The checkbox selection will normally be propagated to the label and text controls in the  checkbox selection listener. However, the callback is only invoked when the selection changes,  which means that an initial value of false will not be properly propagated. The state is  directly updated here.

__label__other Look for any breakpoint (base bp class) that has the same source file and line number as what  is currently being inputed. Careful not to compare with the current dprintf  in the case of modifying the properties of an existing dprintf; in  that case we of course have this particular dprintf at this file and line.
__label__other check if (parentAccess != null) && file exists, then check sb  If resolveLink, the check is performed on the link target.
__label__other In order for this function to be better than the previous best, it must  have at least one parameter match that is better that the corresponding  match for the other function, and none that are worse.
__label__other The AST can be released by a thread other than the one that acquired it.<p>Clients are not allowed to modify the AST and must hold an index readlock prior to calling this method and continue to hold the lock as longas the AST is being used.
__label__other Add in the web services filtersserves if app has them.  Using Jerseyguice integration module. If user has web services  they must have also bound a default one in their webapp code.
__label__other There seems to be an issue with the guicejersey integration  where we have to list the stuff we don't want it to serve  through the guicecontainer. In this case its everything except  the the web services api prefix. We can't just change the filter  from below - that doesn't work.

__label__other This example shows this storage structure for three names in two linkages.NameA2^|NameA1 NameB^ ^| |record --> LinkageA --> LinkageBNameA1 and NameA2 should both be created in LinkageA, NameB should be created in LinkageB.The interface to this class flattens this storage structure so it appears as a simplelist that can be iterated over.Continuing with the same example, the iterator behaves as though the list were:{ NameA1, NameA2, NameB }This class mostly doesn't care about the inner lists. They are implemented using the#getNextInBinding attribute of PDOMName.This class implements the outer list as a singly linked list of "nodes". Each node storesthe linkageId, the record of the first PDOMName in the list, and the record of the next node.

__label__other The input data is treated as fields separated by a user specifiedseparator (the default value is "\t"). The user can specify a list offields that form the reduce output keys, and a list of fields that formthe reduce output values. The fields are the union of those from the keyand those from the value.The field separator is under attribute "mapreduce.fieldsel.data.field.separator"The reduce output field list spec is under attribute"mapreduce.fieldsel.reduce.output.key.value.fields.spec".The value is expected to be like"keyFieldsSpec:valueFieldsSpec" keyvalueFieldsSpec are comma (,)separated field spec: fieldSpec,fieldSpec,fieldSpec ... Each field speccan be a simple number (e.g. 5) specifying a specific field, or a range(like 2-5) to specify a range of fields, or an open range (like 3-)specifying all the fields starting from field 3. The open range fieldspec applies value fields only. They have no effect on the key fields.Here is an example: "4,3,0,1:6,5,1-3,7-". It specifies to use fields4,3,0 and 1 for keys, and use fields 6,5,1,2,3,7 and above for values.
__label__other More specifically, this method depends on these invariants in an ACL:- The list must be sorted.- Each entry in the list must be unique by scope + type + name.- There is exactly one each of the unnamed usergroupother entries.- The mask entry must not have a name.- The other entry must not have a name.- Default entries may be present, but they are ignored during enforcement.
__label__other <p>A {@link StringMapKey} and {@link ClassMapKey} are provided for convenience with maps whosekeys are strings or classes.

__label__other Extract the substring that likely contributes to this Q_PROPERTY declaration. The declaration  could be in any state of being entered, so use the HeuristicScanner to guess about the  possible structure. The fixed assumptions are that the content assistant was invoked within  the expansion parameter of Q_PROPERTY. We try to guess at the end of the String, which is  either the closing paren (within 512 characters from the opening paren) or the current cursor  location.  The offset is always right after the opening paren, use it to get to a fixed point in the  declaration.
__label__other There are two significant regions in a Q_PROPERTY declaration. The first is everything  between the opening paren and the first parameter. This region specifies the type and the  name. The other is the region that declares all the parameters. There is an arbitrary  amount of whitespace between these regions.   This function finds and returns the offset of the end of the region containing the type and  name. Returns 0 if the typename region cannot be found.
__label__other There are two types of proposals. If the previous identifier matches a known attribute name,  then we propose possible values for that attribute. Otherwise we want to propose the identifiers  that don't already appear in the expansion.   This is implemented by iterating over the list of known attributes. If any of the attributes  matches the previous identifier, then we build and return a list of valid proposals for that  attribute.   Otherwise, for each attribute we build a regular expression that checks to see if that token  appears within the expansion. If it already appears, then the attribute is ignored. Otherwise  it is added as an unspecified attribute. If the loop completes, then we create a list of proposals  for from that unspecified list.

__label__other Original set of values. So we can see what has really changed on the save and  perform appropriate change operations. We only really want to operate on changed  values, to avoid generating churn.
__label__other An ACL entry to be applied to a directory's children that do not otherwisehave their own ACL defined. Unlike an access ACL entry, a default ACLentry is not inspected as part of permission enforcement on the directorythat owns it.
__label__other An ACL entry that is inspected during permission checks to enforcepermissions.
__label__other Integer constants written in binary are a non-standard extension  supported by GCC since 4.3 and by some other C compilers  They consist of a prefix 0b or 0B, followed by a sequence of 0 and 1 digits  see http:gcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccBinary-constants.html
__label__other Executor used to synchronize data access in this cache manager.It has to be the same executor that is used by the data generators inorder to guarantee data consistency.
__label__other Make sure that if clients are currently waiting for a count,  they are notified of the update (their request monitors will be  completed with an error). They shoudl then re-request data  from provider again.
__label__other This specific implementation might provide resource management as wellas resource metrics functionality. We need to ensure that the sameinstance is used for both.
__label__other Returns a (possibly null) reference to a cGroupsHandler. This handler isnon-null only if one or more of the known cgroups-based resourcehandlers are in use and have been initialized.
__label__other Represents expansions of the Q_ENUMS macro within a class declaration.<pre>class B : public QObject{Q_OBJECTenum E { enumerator };Q_ENUMS( E )};class Q : public QObject{Q_OBJECTQ_ENUMS( B::E E0 )Q_ENUMS( E1 )enum E0 { e0a, e0b = 2 };enum E1 { e1 };}<pre>NOTE: http:qt-project.orgdocqt-4.8qobject.html#Q_ENUMS<blockquote>If you want to register an enum that is declared in another class, the enum must be fully qualifiedwith the name of the class defining it. In addition, the class defining the enum has to inheritQObject as well as declare the enum using Q_ENUMS().<blockquote>So, the lookup for the C++ enum only needs to look in the same class spec when the name is notqualified. When it is qualified, then it needs to find the QObject and then look at its Q_ENUMS.
__label__other Returns the name of the enumerator as referenced in parameter in the Q_ENUMSmacro expansion. In the sample code in the class declaration, this would return"B::E", "E0", or "E1".
__label__other Returns an unsorted collection of the enumerators contained in the enum referencesin the Q_ENUMS macro expansion.<p>NOTE: It would be nice if the textual order of the enumerators was preserved by theunderlying CDT index, but it is not. The {@link Enumerator#getOrdinal()} method canbe used to recover some ordering information.
__label__other Returns true if this enumeration was introduced to the Qt meta-object system witha Q_FLAGS expansion and false if it was introduced with Q_ENUMS.
__label__other A small wrapper class for the enumerators that are declared within the enum that isreferenced by the parameter of the Q_ENUMS macro expansion.
__label__other Always ensure the selected tab is visible. If server prevents a tab  change we might end up here with visibleWidget == newVisible but its  parent is still hidden.
__label__other lastRecs might have been set to an object already by another thread.  Track the fact that lastRecs has been reset once to make sure refresh  is correctly triggered.
__label__other Operation which selects a random file and attempts to delete that file (if itexists)This operation will capture statistics on success the time taken to deleteand the number of successful deletions that occurred and on failure or errorit will capture the number of failures and the amount of time taken to fail

__label__other A test class for testing GridLayoutExpandRatio. The class is empty becausethe name convention is UIClassName+Test. GridLayoutExpandRatioTest andGridLayoutHideMiddleCellsTest behave the same way but on different UIclasses. Thats why they have different names and zero code.
__label__other Cache the collection of bean properties for a given type to avoid doing aquite expensive lookup multiple times. Will be used from any thread thathappens to process Vaadin requests, so it must be protected fromcorruption caused by concurrent access.
__label__other Decodes a value that is of an internal type.<p>Ensures the encoded value is of the same type as target type.<p><p>Allows restricting collections so that they must be declared usinggenerics. If this is used then all objects in the collection are encodedusing the declared type. Otherwise only internal types are allowed incollections.<p>
__label__other This method transfers data using local buffer. It transfers data froma disk to a local buffer in memory, and then it transfers data from thebuffer to the target. This is used only if transferTo is disallowed inthe configuration file. super.TransferTo does not perform well on Windowsdue to a small IO request generated. customShuffleTransfer can controlthe size of the IO requests by changing the size of the intermediatebuffer.
__label__other We can read more than we need if the actualCount is not multiple of the byteBuffer size and file is big enough. In that case we cannot use flip method but we need to set buffer limit manually to trans.
__label__other The map output field list spec is under attribute"mapreduce.fieldsel.map.output.key.value.fields.spec".The value is expected to be like "keyFieldsSpec:valueFieldsSpec"keyvalueFieldsSpec are comma (,) separated field spec: fieldSpec,fieldSpec,fieldSpec ...Each field spec can be a simple number (e.g. 5) specifying a specific field, or a range(like 2-5) to specify a range of fields, or an open range (like 3-) specifying allthe fields starting from field 3. The open range field spec applies value fields only.They have no effect on the key fields.
__label__other The reduce output field list spec is under attribute"mapreduce.fieldsel.reduce.output.key.value.fields.spec".The reducer extracts output keyvalue pairs in a similar manner, except thatthe key is never ignored.

__label__other Even if the previous check didn't kick in, we may already be in the missing
__label__other Deal with missing secondary prompt, if needed.
__label__other If so, we'll need to pretend we are receiving the secondary prompt.
__label__other We should get 1 incremental block report.
__label__other We should not receive any more incremental or incremental block reports,  since the interval we configured is so long.
__label__other by JAR spec, if there is a manifest, it must be the first entry in the  ZIP.
__label__other Returns the full path to the Jar containing the class. It always return aJAR.
__label__other Internal class designed to delete the output directory. Meant solely foruse before and after the test is run; this is so next iterations of thetest do not encounter a "file already exists" error.

__label__other otherwise. If onFinish is false, the project is temporary and can be removedif cancel is pressed.
__label__other Note: This method is for internal use only. Clients should not call this method.
__label__other When serialized, this header is written out as a protocol buffer, precededby a 4-byte integer representing the full packet length, and a 2-byte shortrepresenting the header length.
__label__other Only set syncBlock if it is specified.
__label__other We should only have a non-positive data length for the last packet
__label__other The last packet should not contain data
__label__other Seqnos should always increase by 1 with each packet received
__label__other Platform's SpellingService uses a spelling engine that is independentof the content type (see https:bugs.eclipse.orgbugsshow_bug.cgi?id=185695).We are providing our own SpellingService to be able to use the CC++ specificspelling engine even when it is not selected inPreferencesGeneralEditorsText EditorsSpelling.
__label__other Why integers and not enums? Cross platform serialization as JSON
__label__other the third element in each entry , the path, MUST be the same in each entry.A client reading the addresses of an endpoint is free to pick anyof the set, so they must be the same.

__label__other Have to temporarily turn off the "remove terminated launches when new one created"  preference because it does not work well for multilaunch
__label__other Since the TemplateEngine consists of UI(Wizard).A TestWizard is created to which the dynamically generatedUIPages are added. The Wizard is launched from here.The TestCases created to test the TemplateEngine is initialized here.
__label__other Now that we added the launch in our list, we have already  received the real launchChanged event, and did not know it was part of our list  So, fake another event now.
__label__other Now we need to override the history to make multi-launch appear last, if we don't do it last launch would be our child's launch which is not correct for repeating the experience
__label__other You can inject the app in views if needed.
__label__other param is milliseconds
__label__other This is borrowed and slightly modified from Guava's {@link UnsignedBytes}class to be able to compare arrays that start at non-zero offsets.

__label__other Get our added instance or another instance that was added by  another thread between previous get and putIfAbsent
__label__other not build for this one
__label__other make sure the value is within the range
__label__other <p>Because a bimap has unique values, this method returns a {@link Set},instead of the {@link java.util.Collection} specified in the {@link Map}interface.
__label__other give the updater thread some time to update the resource
__label__other give the updater thread some time to update the resource
__label__other Class parameters must be raw, so we can't create a proxy with generictype arguments. The created proxy only records calls and returns null, sothe type is irrelevant at runtime.
__label__other <h3>ML columns<h3>A column with ML attributes attached is called an ML column.The data in ML columns are stored as double values, i.e., an ML column is either a scalar columnof double values or a vector column.Columns of other types must be encoded into ML columns using transformers.We use {@link org.apache.spark.ml.attribute.Attribute} to describe a scalar ML column, and{@link org.apache.spark.ml.attribute.AttributeGroup} to describe a vector ML column.ML attributes are stored in the metadata field of the column schema.
__label__other See bugzilla 108715 for the discussion of dependency management that led tothe creation of this dependency calculator. Note also that this techniqueexhibits the failure modes discussed in comment #5.

__label__other we are expecting this
__label__other this has no effect?
__label__other QMetaMethod cannot be statically analyzed.
__label__other There are 4 overloads of QObject::disconnect (Qt 4.8.4). They can be distinguished by examining  the type of the second parameter. The number of parameters is used to disambiguate one conflict.  disconnect( , const char, , ) && 4 params  disconnect( , QMetaMethod&, , )  disconnect( , const QObject, )  disconnect( , const char) && 2 params
__label__other bad path should also fail
__label__other The simplest way to convert from the CLITraceInfo to a MIBreakInsertInfo  is to list the breakpoints and take the proper output
__label__other By default the tracepoint is enabled at creation  If it wasn't supposed to be, then disable it right away  Also, tracepoints are created with no passcount.  We have to set the passcount manually now.  Same for commands.
__label__other At this point, we know their are OK so there is no need to re-validate
__label__other IgnoreCount is not supported by tracepoints
__label__other This can be different from the designated replication factor of the filebecause the namenode does not maintain replication for the blocks which arecurrently being written to. Depending on the configuration, the client maycontinue to write to a block even if a few datanodes in the write pipelinehave failed, or the client may add a new datanodes once a datanode hasfailed.
__label__other this is a very inefficient implementation for getting all the identifiers  for a class
__label__other It makes all properties defined in the <code>superClassName<code>available for <code>baseClassName<code> as well.
__label__other First line of input has 'key' 'tab' 'value'  Second line of input starts with a tab character.  So, it has empty key and the whole line as value.  Third line of input does not have any tab character.  So, the whole line is the key and value is empty.
__label__other During tests, the default Configuration will use a local mapred  So don't specify -config or -cluster
__label__other In non-stop mode threads that are running have no state change reason
__label__other This is a regression test for HADOOP-9103.

__label__other Contributions By Racks are  Rack1 175  Rack2 275  Rack3 150  So, Rack2 hosts, host4 and host 3 should be returned  even if their individual contribution is not the highest
__label__other host1 makes the highest contribution among all hosts  So, that should be returned before others
__label__other it's okay to mark even if mark isn't supported, as reset won't work
__label__other The maps are incrementally updated as described below:1. Initialize the maps as empty.2. Incrementally update the maps- When ShellBasedIdMapping is requested for user or group name givenan ID, or for ID given a user or group name, do look up in the mapfirst, if it doesn't exist, find the corresponding entry with shellcommand, and insert the entry to the maps.- When group ID is requested for a given group name, and if thegroup name is numerical, the full group map is loaded. Because wedon't have a good way to find the entry for a numerical group name,loading the full map helps to get in all entries.3. Periodically refresh the maps for both user and group, e.g,do step 1.
__label__other If can't update the maps, will keep using the old ones
__label__other Because user or group id are treated as Integer (signed integer or int32)here, the number 4294967294 is out of range. The solution is to convertuint32 to int32, so to map the out-of-range ID to the negative side ofInteger, e.g. 4294967294 maps to -2 and 4294967295 maps to -1.
__label__other if the static mapping file  - was modified after last update, load the map again;  - did not exist but was added since last update, load the map;  - existed before but deleted since last update, clear the map

__label__other project reference updated - may throw an exception if unable to write .cdtproject file updateProjectReferencesIfNecessary();
__label__other ensure that if changed, the order is consistent
__label__other A concrete implementation of this class is generated by WidgetMapGenerator orone of its subclasses during widgetset compilation.
__label__other If there is a mismatch between what was written and what was expected,a small range of bytes either side of the first error are logged to aiddiagnosing what problem occurred -whether it was a previous fileor a corrupting of the current file. This assumes that twosequential runs to the same path use datasets with different charactermoduli.
__label__other .DELETE_ON_ERROR'If `.DELETE_ON_ERROR' is mentioned as a target anywhere in themakefile, then `make' will delete the target of a rule if it haschanged and its commands exit with a nonzero exit status, just asit does when it receives a signal.
__label__other Since the bimap is immutable, ImmutableBiMap doesn't require special logicfor keeping the bimap and its inverse in sync during serialization, the wayAbstractBiMap does.
__label__other Casting to any type is safe because the set will never hold any elements.
__label__other looking for of() with > 5 entries? Use the builder instead.
__label__other <p>The sort order is stable, that is, if two entries have values that compareas equivalent, the entry that was inserted first will be first in the built map'siteration order.
__label__other If entries is full, then this implementation may end up using the entries arraydirectly and writing over the entry objects with non-terminal entries, but this issafe; if this Builder is used further, it will grow the entries array (so it can'taffect the original array), and future build() calls will always copy any entryobjects that cannot be safely reused.
__label__other <p>Despite the method name, this method attempts to avoid actually copyingthe data when it is safe to do so. The exact circumstances under which acopy will or will not be performed are undocumented and subject to change.

__label__other we have a most-recently-used working set. Just  take the first in tree order
__label__other YARN doesn't have the concept of slots per task, set it as 1.
__label__other The AM should decode both parts of the message. The {@linkStrictPreemptionContract} specifies particular allocations that the RMrequires back. The AM can checkpoint containers' state, adjust its executionplan to move the computation, or take no action and hope that conditions thatcaused the RM to ask for the container will change.<p>In contrast, the {@link PreemptionContract} also includes a description ofresources with a set of containers. If the AM releases containers matchingthat profile, then the containers enumerated in {@linkPreemptionContract#getContainers()} may not be killed.<p>Each preemption message reflects the RM's current understanding of thecluster state, so a request to return <em>N<em> containers may notreflect containers the AM is releasing, recently exited containers the RM hasyet to learn about, or new containers allocated before the message wasgenerated. Conversely, an RM may request a different profile of containers insubsequent requests.<p>The policy enforced by the RM is part of the scheduler. Generally, onlycontainers that have been requested consistently should be killed, but thedetails are not specified.

__label__other If there are already free resources for the container to start, and  there are no queued containers waiting to be executed, start this  container immediately.
__label__other If container is null and distributed scheduling is enabled, container  might be queued. Otherwise, container might not be handled by this NM.
__label__other If container was indeed running, update allocated resource utilization.
__label__other Please note that this method should be called even if the profiler is notenabled because it will then remove a logger function that might havebeen included in the HTML page and that would leak memory unless removed.
__label__other If this editor is for a project file, remove this editor as a property  change listener.
__label__other If there isn't already a node for this name's linkage then the new name can be inserted  in the normal way.
__label__other Otherwise update the node's head field to point to the given name.
__label__other If a node is found that has a name in the list, then update this iterator to  point to the next linkage's node (this is so the next call to advance starts  at the right place).
__label__other If nothing is found then there is no more iterating.
__label__other Why not just use obj.toString()? That method is often overridden, and socannot be relied on for a representation that uniquely identifies theobject in the VM space.
__label__other if we are right before the text start  line end, and already after the insertion point  then just shift to the right

__label__other If this is a name for a QML registration, then the registration must be removed  from the index.
__label__other If the block is corrupted, it means all its available replicas are  corrupted. We don't mark it as missing given these available replicas  might still be accessible as the block might be incorrectly marked as  corrupted by client machines.
__label__other If there were internal errors during the fsck operation, we want to  return FAILURE_STATUS, even if those errors were not immediately  fatal. Otherwise many unit tests will pass even when there are bugs.
__label__other If no last configuration or user has changed  the executable, we need to create a new configuration  and remove artifacts from the old one.
__label__other We should only need to backup the length of Q_PROPERTY, but allow extra to deal  with whitespace.
__label__other If the previous token is an Attribute name that has a parameter then suggest appropriate  values for that parameter. Otherwise suggest the other Attribute names.
__label__other If the cursor is in whitespace, then the current identifier is null. Scan backward to find  the start of this whitespace.
__label__other Note that if the nested form is the first or last field in the parent  form, styles from the parent (padding, ...) may leak to its contents.
__label__other If no users are present, consider AM Limit for that queue.

__label__other A marker file that is created on each root directory if a rolling upgradeis in progress. The NN does not inform the DN when a rolling upgrade isfinalized. All the DN can infer is whether or not a rolling upgrade iscurrently in progress. When the rolling upgrade is not in progress:1. If the marker file is present, then a rolling upgrade just completed.If a 'previous' directory exists, it can be deleted now.2. If the marker file is absent, then a regular upgrade may be inprogress. Do not delete the 'previous' directory.

Otherwise, ifcheckpoint data exists in ~checkpoint, then it will create StreamingContext fromthe checkpoint data.Refer to the online documentation for more details.
__label__other This option will make the DSF-GDB launch fail, and on Linux we have a problem where it will hang  Since this option was added for multi-process but it has not been completed for Linux yet, just hide it completely for now
__label__other Note: painting is done in order objects were added,so objects added last are drawn "on top" of others.Use raiselower methods to change the object z-ordering, if needed.
__label__other numberOfIds should be about 60 after scrolling down the table
__label__other This helper method will invoke the specified function in parallel for eachend point in the specified list using a thread pool and return theresponses received from the function. It implements the logic required fordispatching requests in parallel and waiting for the responses. If any ofthe function call fails or times out, it will ignore and proceed with therest. So the responses returned can be less than the number of end pointsspecified
__label__other Create a request intercepter pipeline for testing. The last one in the  chain will call the mock resource manager. The others in the chain will  simply forward it to the next one in the chain
__label__other Note: We add the scanner-config even if the resource doesn't actually exist below this project (which may happen when reading existing build logs, because resources can be created as part of the build and may not exist at the time of analyzing the config but re-built later on. if (getProject().exists(relPath)) {
