# Comment-Quality
Install all modules required with 'pip install -r requirements.txt' and install srcML to your PATH. Tested and developed on Windows and Python 3.8

If using Mac or Linux, run the setup.sh script to port the project over and handle all requirements. This will allow you to work with main.py right away, to generate an output.json file from a downloaded test project. 

All runnable files...

and use absolute paths as the arguments.
